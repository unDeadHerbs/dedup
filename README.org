* Intelligent Automated File Deduplication

Inspired by [[https://github.com/adrianlopezroche/fdupes][fdupes]], I'd like a progam that removed duplicate files; but, I'm lazy and want to let *safely* it run under chron.

This program searches in a given directory for files with the same hash and then checks their names to choose the one that is "best".
